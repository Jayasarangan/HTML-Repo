The game is set in a fantasy-themed[3] persistent world[4] where the player is a chief of a village.<br> Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other player's villages with troops; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by producing them at their own village<br>. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. <br>Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people, who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.<br> The minimum number of players of a Clan War is thirty<br>.
